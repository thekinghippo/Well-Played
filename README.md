# Screenshots
- The first page on the app prompts a sign in for the users summoner name. This is completely optional and the user may use the rest of the app without this information. If the information is input then the startscreen of the app will be the "summoner page" with displays the last champ they played along with some basic information about themselves and their last 10 matches.<br>

- This is what the summary page looks like. It's purpose is just to display some basic information about the player and be a nice homepage for when the app initializes.<br>

<br><br>
- Clicking on the "champions" button will take us to the champion list. Champions may be filtered by role to make them easier to find.<br>

<br><br>
- Clicking on a champion takes us to a more detailed look at them. Initially we are greeted by their splash screen and lore.<br>

<br><br>
- Same logic here as the "champions" page, clicking an item takes us to a more detailed view for the chosen item. Clicking on tems in the "build tree" and "builds into" sections of this page will redirect us to the detailed page for those items.<br>

- Currently, there aren't actually any settings in the app, but the "Settings/About" page prominently displayed RIOT's disclaimer and will house options in the future.<br>

- You may be wondering where the "Summoner Lookup" button goes. It's virtually identical to the "Summoner" page except it's meant for others. This concludes our tour! :D
